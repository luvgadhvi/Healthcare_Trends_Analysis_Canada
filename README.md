# Healthcare Trends Analysis in Canada

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of healthcare trends across Canada, focusing on healthcare utilization, medical conditions, and insurance coverage from [Kaggle's healthcare dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset). The dataset has been expanded to include specific data about hospitals in Canada and associated geographic locations, enabling detailed insights at the provincial and city levels.

## Objective
The objective of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze key healthcare metrics to support better decision-making within the Canadian healthcare system. The report examines trends such as average hospital stays, medical condition prevalence, insurance provider market shares, and more.

## Data Source
The project utilizes an updated healthcare dataset that includes:
- Original data from Kaggle: [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)
- Custom additions include information on Canadian hospitals and geographic mapping of data.

## Power BI Report Navigation
- **Introduction**: Overview of the dashboard and its features.
- **Executive Summary**: Key insights and metrics from the data analysis.
- **Province Overview**: Examination of healthcare trends by province.
- **City Overview**: Detailed insights into healthcare data at the city level.
- **Hospital Overview**: Analysis specific to individual hospitals.
- **Key Influencers**: Factors influencing healthcare metrics such as admission rates and medical condition prevalence.

## Power BI Report Features and Techniques
In this project, we have employed a variety of data modeling and transformation techniques within Power BI to ensure a robust analysis of healthcare data. Here are the key features and techniques used in our Power BI report:

### Data Modeling
- Comprehensive **data model** creation to connect various data sources effectively.

### Data Transformation
Using Power Query, we implemented several data transformation steps:
- **Type changing** to ensure correct data types for analysis.
- **Cleaning** data to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
- **Merging** multiple data sources to enrich the dataset.
- Creation of **calculated columns** to derive new insights.
- Development of **measures**, both simple and grouped, for dynamic analysis.

### Report Features
- **Reports for checking column quality**, distribution, and profiles to maintain data integrity.
- Utilization of **groups**, **hierarchies**, and **roles** to enhance data exploration.
- Implementation of **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to ensure data privacy and relevance.
- **Drill-through** capabilities for detailed data exploration.
- Interactive elements like **buttons** and **bookmarks** for a dynamic user experience.

### Report Customizations
- Custom visuals and layouts to tailor the dashboard to specific analysis needs.

### Advanced Analysis Techniques
- Employed advanced analytical techniques to uncover deeper insights and trends.

### Reference Book
This project also referenced **"Learn Power BI - Second Edition" by Greg Deckler** to enhance the depth and sophistication of our data analysis.

## Analytics Questions Addressed
1. Prevalence and distribution of top medical conditions by province and city.
2. Comparison of hospital stay durations for major conditions across provinces.
3. Common medications for prevalent conditions and their correlation at the city level.
4. Market share analysis of insurance providers.
5. Correlation between blood types and medical conditions.
6. Trends in different types of hospital admissions.
7. Analysis of billing amounts across healthcare services.
